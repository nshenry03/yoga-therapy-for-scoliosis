## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Stand with your feet mat distance apart, toes turned out comfortably.
- Squat down, making sure your knees are tracking in the same direction as your
  toes, and bring your arms in front of you, between your knees.
- Spread your shoulder blades and use your upper arms to keep your knees over
  your ankles.
- Allow your spine to round and relax your neck.
- You are looking for sensations along the spine, all the way up to the neck and
  in your hips and groins.
- Hold for 1 to 3 minutes.
- To come out of the pose, either sit back on your buttocks and straighten your
  legs or come up into Dangling and slowly roll the spine up.

## Beginners' tips

- If your heels don’t touch the floor, support them with blocks or a folded
  blanket.
- If your hips are tight, bring the arms into a prayer position and use your
  elbows to gently press against your shins.
- If your neck is sensitive, use a block to support your forehead.

## Watch out for

- ​​​​​The knees and feet should point in the same direction. Spread your feet
  wider if they don’t.
- Avoid in case of knee injuries.

## Variations

- Adjust the distance of your feet depending on your targeted area: bring your
  feet closer to target the ankles and wider to target the hips.
- Place your hands behind your neck (without pulling) to increase the stretch.
- Squat with your hips against the wall, to feel an even deeper decompression in
  the lower back and hip area.
- If you want to hold this pose for longer than 3 minutes, try a few sessions of
  2 minutes each, coming into Dangling for a minute in between.
