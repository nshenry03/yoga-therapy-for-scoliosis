## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Most people will benefit from sitting on a folded blanket or cushion for this
  pose.
- From a seated position, with your legs outstretched, spread your legs apart.
  Fold forward from the hips and allow your spine to round and your neck to
  relax. Rest your hands in front of you.
- You are looking for diffused sensations along the inner thighs and the spine.
- Hold for 3 to 5 minutes.
- To come out of the pose, use your hands to push the floor away and slowly roll
  up. Lean back on your hands to release your hips and gently bring your legs
  together.
- Allow a few minutes to feel the effects of the pose before moving into a
  counter pose.

## Beginners' tips

- If sitting on a cushion still doesn’t allow you to tilt your pelvis forward,
  bend your knees and support them with folded blankets or blocks. Your feet
  could even be flat on the floor.
- If bending the knees doesn’t work for you, try the Half Dragonfly variation.

## Watch out for

- Can aggravate Sciatica
- In case of knee or back issues that don’t allow flexion of the spine, replace
  with the Yang version: [Upavistha Konasana]

## Variations

- You can stack bolsters in front of you and allow your chest and upper body to
  relax on them.
- If your neck is sensitive, place your elbows in front of you, on blocks or a
  bolster if needed, and support your chin with you hands.
- If your feet naturally fall inwards or outwards, you could support them with
  blocks to keep them facing towards the ceiling and explore different
  sensations.
- Place meditation cushion or bolsters on your thighs (never on the knees) to
  ground your hips.
- You can fold over one leg to explore different sensations in the legs and
  spine, with the option to rotate the chest towards the ceiling. In that case,
  support your head with one hand and find a comfortable position for the
  opposite shoulder. Repeat on the other side.
- If you feel compression in the groin, Half Dragonfly may allow you to get
  around it: from a Dragonfly position, bring one foot in, towards your groin.
  You have the option to side bend or to fold forward.
- Try Dragonfly at the wall: lie with your buttocks at the wall, bring your legs
  up and spread them apart. If this is uncomfortable, use block to support them.
  You could also use the wall in the same way for Half Dragonfly.
