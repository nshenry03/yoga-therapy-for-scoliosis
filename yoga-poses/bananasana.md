## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Lie down on your back, legs straight, arms overhead.
- With your buttocks firmly anchored on the mat, move both of your legs to the
  left. Use your left foot to keep your right foot in place, by crossing your
  ankles
- Buttocks still anchored on the mat, bring your upper body to the left allowing
  your spine to bend to the side, clasping your right wrist with your right hand
- Hold for 3 to 5 minutes
- You are looking for stimulation in the side body. You may feel more sensations
  in the upper body (ribs, shoulders, arms), the lower body (along the hips and
  thighs) or both.
- To come out of the pose, slowly bring your body back to neutral.
- Lift your head to make sure that you’re lying straight and take a few moments
  in Savasana to integrate the effects of this pose.

## Beginners' tips

You might not feel much in this pose right away. Take a few moments to allow the
first sensations to arise then adjust further if you’re looking for greater
sensation.

## Watch out for

Avoid any tingling sensations in the arms. If this occurs, adjust the arm
position, elevate them with a bolster or try holding onto your elbows instead of
your wrists.

## Variations

- You can adjust the position of your pelvis to target sensations in the front
  side body or the back side body.
- Use a strap to go deeper in the pose: Make a small loop and place it around
  your left ankle. Hold the other side of the strap, as low as possible, with
  your left hand. Use your right arm to put tension on the strap (a bit like a
  bow and an arrow). Doing this can intensify the side bend, while still keeping
  the muscles relaxed.
