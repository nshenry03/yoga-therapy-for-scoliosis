## Step-by-Step Instructions

- From all fours, knees a little wider than hip-distance apart, lower down onto
  your elbows
- Keep your hips in line with your knees, straighten your arms in front of you,
  one after the other.
- Place your chin or forehead on the floor, allowing yourself to soften in the
  pose.
- If you feel a pressure on the top of your shoulders, bend your elbows, spread
  them to the sides and place your forehead on your hands.
- You are looking for opening sensations in the front body (chest, ribs, front
  of the shoulders, maybe even the belly) and a mild compression in the upper
  and middle back.
- Hold for 3 to 5 minutes.
- To come out of the pose, gently bring your hands towards your shoulders and
  lower your hips on your heels, coming into a comfortable Child’s Pose
  variation.

## Beginners' tips

- Use a blanket to pad your knees and a bolster to support your chest.

## Watch out for

- Avoid tingling sensations in the arms while extended. Try spreading them
  wider, bend the elbows and rest your forehead on your hands or extend one arm
  at a time, and switch half way through.

## Variations

- Place the short-end side of your mat a few centimeters away from the wall. Sit
  on your heels, and place your hands on the wall a comfortable distance apart.
  Allow your chest to dip down, head resting against the wall or gently hanging
- Try holding a block between the heels of your hands. This variation encourages
  a small amount of muscular engagement, and should not be held longer than 1
  minute. However, it will offer you sensations in the armpit area.
