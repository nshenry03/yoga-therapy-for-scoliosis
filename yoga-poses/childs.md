## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Sit on your heels

  either stretched out to the front, by your side or hands underneath your
  forehead)

- Bring your upper body to the right allowing your spine to bend to the side
- Bring your head down to the floor
- Hold for 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Come out of the pose as before
- Bring your upper body to the center allowing your spine lengthen equally
  between both sides
- Bring your head down to the floor
- Hold for 90 seconds to 5 minutes
- Come out of the pose as before
- Sit on your heels for a few moments

## Beginners' tips

- If ankles are tight, place a rolled up blanket underneath to diminish the
  stretch.
- If hips do not reach the heels, place a cushion or bolster on your heels for
  support.

## Watch out for

- Avoid if pregnant.
- In case of back issues, spread your knees wider to keep the spine straight.

## Variations

- In case of knee issues, place a rolled up blanket behind your knee joint, in
  between your thighs and calves.
- Spread your knees if you feel compression in the groin, and place a bolster
  lengthwise under your chest.
- If your hips rest on your your heels, place a wheat-filled meditation cushion
  or sandbag on your sacrum for a grounding sensation.
