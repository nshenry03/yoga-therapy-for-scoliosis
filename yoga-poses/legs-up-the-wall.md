## Step-by-Step Instructions

Place a yoga mat or another firm, padded surface perpendicular to a wall.

1. On the mat, cozy up to the wall sideways, getting your hip and shoulder as
   close to the wall as you can.
1. Rotate yourself around so that your legs and feet go up the wall as you take
   your head away from the wall to lie down. Keep your butt as close to the wall
   as possible. Scoot your butt closer to the wall if you need to. You want your
   legs close to 90 degrees. They are as straight as you can get them
   comfortably but don't lock your knees.
1. Make sure your shoulders and hips are in a line, and your back is in neutral
   spine—there will be curves under your low back and behind your neck.
1. Relax your shoulders, moving them away from your ears. Let your arms lie
   loosely at your sides. Palms up or down.
1. Balance your body weight side to side.
1. Relax: Just lie there and do some deep breathing. You might want to mentally
   scan your body for tight places and let those go. Let go of as much tension
   as you can in your legs and hips. Feel the weight of the legs falling down,
   through the hips and into the floor.
1. When you are ready, come out of the pose. Fold your knees to your chest, roll
   to your side, and push onto hands and knees. Push your weight back to your
   feet and come to standing. You can roll your spine up, or you can stay folded
   at the hip and use your hands on your thighs to help yourself up the rest of
   the way.

## Common Mistakes

This pose is easy to achieve, but be sure to avoid these errors.

### Breathing

Don't hold your breath. Taking conscious, deep breaths can enhance the
relaxation of this pose.

### Getting Into and out of the Pose

If you lack flexibility and agility you might find it harder to get down and
back up from this pose. Take it slow and be sure not to twist or use forceful
actions.

## Modifications and Variations

As with many yoga poses and Pilates exercises, there are ways to change this to
match your skill level.

### Modifications

Some people like a neck roll under their neck or a small folded blanket under
their shoulders and head.

If you have difficulty keeping your legs in position, you might use a yoga strap
to keep them together.

### Challenges

Placing a couple of blankets or a bolster under your hips makes this more of an
inversion.

While your legs are up, you might also enjoy stretching them into a wide V shape
or bending your knees so that the soles of your feet are together as the edges
of the feet stay against the wall.
