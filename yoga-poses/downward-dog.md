## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Start in an all fours position, with your hips above your knees and shoulders
  above your wrists.
- Bring your hands slightly forwards of your shoulders, with your middle finger
  pointing forward, spread your fingers.
- Think about creating a suction cup in the middle of your palm by pressing
  through the outer edges of the palm, the base of the fingers and the
  fingertips. This is called [Hasta Bandha].
- Create a spiral action in your arms by rolling your upper arms away from you
  and your forearms spiralling inwards (see Beginners’ tips for more detailed
  instructions).
- Tuck your toes under, and on an exhalation, engage your lower belly drawing
  the navel back to the spine. Press through your hands and lift your hips back
  and up to bring yourself into an upside-down V pose.
- Keep your knees bent at first as you find length in your spine.
- Slide your shoulder blades down along the spine, collar bones spread. The base
  of the neck relaxed.
- Maintaining length in the spine, ‘walk your dog’ by alternately bending and
  straightening your legs. Eventually bringing both heels towards the floor.
  They do not have to touch the floor.
- Stay for 5 breaths.
- To come out of the pose, bring your knees back down to the floor and come into
  Child’s pose or transition into a lunge by stepping one foot towards your
  hands.

## Beginners' tips

- It’s more important to keep length in the spine than straight legs. So if you
  find you are rounding in your back or you are hunching your shoulders it’s
  fine to keep the knees bent as much as you need to so you can enjoy the
  stretch in your back. And remember your heels don’t need to touch the floor!
- The spiral action of the arms can be tricky at first so try it while you are
  sitting on your heels. Read Marlene Henny's advice on [arm rotation in
  Downward Dog] and watch her class on the topic for lots of tips.
- You can work on the pose by practicing against a wall. Stand facing the wall
  about a metre / 3 feet away with your legs hip distance apart. Place your
  hands on the wall (use the same arm rotation as in the steps above). Walk your
  hands down the wall until your torso and arms are parallel to the floor.

## Watch out for

- Make sure the knuckle of the first finger is firmly pressing down, to protect
  your wrists.
- Shift your weight back into the hips.
- If you are hyper-mobile, avoid locking your elbows by keeping a micro-bend in
  your arms.
- Check if you are hunching up your shoulders – try nodding and shaking your
  head to keep the base of your neck relaxed.

## Variations

- Try a dynamic variation, lifting up onto the balls of your feet to find more
  length in the spine and lowering your heels down, maintaining that length.
- Try the [Three-legged dog variation], lifting one of your legs up, keeping
  your hips level and your foot flex. Repeat on the other side.
- For more of a focus on the arms, loop a belt around your arms, just above the
  elbows and press against the strap. Same for the legs. Place a belt on your
  upper legs above the knees and work on active legs drawing thighs outwards.
