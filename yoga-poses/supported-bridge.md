## Step-by-Step Instructions

You will need your yoga block or a similar solid bolster handy.

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet flat on the
   floor.
1. Extend your arms on the floor with your fingers reaching toward your heels.
   You should be able to just barely touch the backs of your heels with your
   fingertips.
1. Keep your feet parallel. Maintain that position throughout the pose.
1. Press down into the soles of your feet to lift your hips off the floor.
1. Slide your yoga block under your back directly under your sacrum, letting it
   rest securely on the bolster. Your arms can stay outstretched on the floor
   next to your body.
1. This should be a comfortable position. You may want to stay here several
   minutes as your body settles into the stretch and gets the benefits of a
   passive backbend. If the pose causes your back to hurt, remove the block and
   come down.
1. To come out, press down into your feet and lift your hips again. Slide the
   block out from under your sacrum and gently lower your back to the floor.
1. For a counter pose, hold your knees to your chest for 5 to 10 breaths.

## Common Mistakes

Beginners and those with back pain should be sure that the block is under the
sacrum, which is between the coccyx (tailbone) and the lower back. You don't
want the block centered too much on the tailbone or the lower back, but rather
in that sweet spot in between.

## Modifications and Variations

Beginners can find a modification to make this pose easier while developing
their skills. You can also make changes to challenge yourself as you progress.

### Modifications

A standard yoga block can be set up at three different heights, depending on the
side that is on the floor. When you first try this pose, it's a good idea to
start with the block on the lowest height, since this is its most stable and
gentle position.

If the lowest height feels comfortable and you want a deeper stretch, you can
try turning it. The highest height will give you the deepest backbend, but it is
also the least stable, so go carefully. Since this is a restorative pose, choose
the level that gives you the most ease. If you feel any pain, come out.

### Challenges

If you feel very stable, try lifting one leg off the floor while keeping the
block in place under your sacrum. Straighten your lifted leg up to the ceiling,
or try bending it and placing your ankle on the thigh of the opposite leg (the
one still on the floor) for a hip opener. Keep the foot of the raised leg flexed
in either position. After several breaths, return that foot to the floor and try
the other side.

You may also lift both legs at the same time, which is a supported version
of [Shoulder Stand].
