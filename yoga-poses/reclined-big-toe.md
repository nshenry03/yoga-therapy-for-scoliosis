## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Lie on your back, legs extended, feet flexed pressing out through the heels.
- On an exhalation draw the right knee into your chest, loop a strap around the
  arch of the right foot, or hook your first two fingers around your big toe.
- Extend the right leg up to the ceiling. Straighten your arms but keep both
  your shoulders on the mat.
- Keep your left leg engaged and press the top of your left thigh down with your
  hand.  Extend through the right heel creating a comfortable stretch in your
  hamstrings.
- Stay for 5 breaths, then open your right leg out bringing it towards the floor
  on your right side. Keep the left hip grounded. Stay for 5 more breaths.
- Bring your leg back to centre and then lower it back to the mat. Repeat on the
  other side.

## Beginners' tips

- You can keep your left leg bent, foot flat on the floor while extending the
  right leg with the help of a strap. Then when bringing the bent leg out to the
  side let the other leg fall out to the other side as well to balance the
  hips.
- Use a pillow under your head if it’s more comfortable for you.
- When bringing the leg out to the side you can rest the thigh on a block or
  cushion to allow more release in the inner thigh.

## Watch out for

- Use the strap as long as you need it to avoid over-stretching your hamstrings.
- Keep the muscles of both legs active, extending through the heels. However,
  avoid locking the knees. Think about engaging the thighs and lifting the knee
  caps as in [Mountain Pose].
