## Step-by-Step Instructions

- From all fours, slide your right knee forward, more or less behind your right
  wrist.
- Pay attention not to stress your right knee: bring it inwards or towards to
  edge of the mat to avoid any discomfort.
- Place your ankle somewhere in front of your left hip and flex your foot.
- Tuck your left toes under and slide your foot towards the back as far as you
  comfortably can. Make sure that your left leg is in line with the upper body
  and rest on the top of the foot with the toes tracking backwards.
- Centre your weight between your hips.
- Stack your arm bones on top of each other and allow your body weight to sink
  down
- Try the Sleeping Swan version by bringing your elbows down or lying completely
  over your right leg.
- You are looking for a stretch in your hips, hip flexors and a mild stimulation
  of the sacral region.
- Hold for 1 to 3 minutes or up to 5 minutes in the Sleeping Swan version.
- To come out of the pose, tuck your left toes under and slide your back knee
  forwards.
- You can move from this position to [Down Dog] before repeating on the left
  side.

## Beginners' tips

- Place a folded blanket under the hip of your bent leg, for support.

## Watch out for

- ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Ensure you avoid any discomfort in your knees. If discomfort
  occurs, try Eye of the Needle pose.

## Variations

- Lying down, place a bolster lengthwise to support your upper body, or a block
  to support your head.
- You can incorporate a gentle twist before coming out of the pose. To do so,
  slowly push the floor away with your hands if you chose the Sleeping Swan
  variation, place your left hand more or less in front of your right knee, find
  length in the spine and gently twist over your right shoulder for a few
  breaths.
