## Step-by-Step Instructions

You can perform Cat-Cow on an exercise mat or on a carpeted floor.

### Starting Position: All Fours

1. Start on your hands and knees, aligning your wrists underneath your shoulders
   and your knees underneath your hips.
1. Think of the spine as a straight line connecting the shoulders to the hips.
   Try visualizing the line extending forward through the crown of the head and
   back through the tailbone. This is the position of a neutral spine.
1. Keep the neck long by looking down and out.

### Inhale and Arch for Cow Pose

1. Curl your toes under.
1. Tilt your pelvis back so that your tailbone sticks up.
1. Let this movement ripple from your tailbone up your spine so that your neck
   is the last thing to move.
1. Your belly drops down, but keep your abdominal muscles hugging your spine by
   drawing your navel in.
1. Take your gaze gently up toward the ceiling without cranking your neck.

### Exhale and Round for Cat Pose

1. Release the tops of your feet to the floor.
1. Tip your pelvis forward, tucking your tailbone. Again, let this action move
   up your spine. Your spine will naturally round.
1. Draw your navel toward your spine.
1. Drop your head.
1. Take your gaze to your navel.

Repeat the Cat-Cow Stretch on each inhale and exhale, matching the movement to
your own breath.

Continue for 5 to 10 breaths, moving the whole spine. After your final exhale,
come back to a neutral spine.

## Common Mistakes

To maintain the correct stretch and prevent injury or strain, avoid these
errors.

### Don't Strain Your Neck

When you lift your gaze to the ceiling, do so with control and don't overextend
your neck. When you go into Cat, let your head drop naturally rather than
forcing it down. Also, be sure to keep your shoulders relaxed and not drawn up
toward your ears.

### Keep the Movement in the Spine

Keep the arms straight so the movement is with the spine and not your arms and
elbows.

## Modifications and Variations

There are ways to modify this pose if you have restrictions or if you want to
make it more challenging.

### Need a Modification?

If you find this pose hurts your wrists, create fists to rest on instead of an
open hand. You can also place blocks underneath your hands for added support.
For knee discomfort, more padding under your knees can help. Try folding your
mat for added cushioning or use a yoga blanket.

If you have trouble coming to your hands and knees or if you want to sneak in
a few stretches at work, you can adapt Cat-Cow into a chair yoga pose. The
movements are pretty much the same as they are on the floor.

Begin by sitting in a chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands on
your knees. Take a few breaths to establish a position with your shoulders over
your hips and a nice long spine

#### Inhale

1. Tilt your pelvis back, emphasizing your tail. Your belly will round forward.
1. Pull your shoulders down and back.
1. Look up towards the ceiling.

#### Exhale

1. Tilt your pelvis back, tucking your tail under. Your spine will round.
1. Pull your navel in.
1. Curve your shoulders forward and take your gaze toward your belly.

Repeat these movements on each inhale and exhale for five to 10 breaths.

### Up for a Challenge?

In the Cat portion of the pose, deepen it by drawing your navel in as firmly as
possible.
