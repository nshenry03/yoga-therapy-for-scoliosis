## Step-by-Step Instructions

- From a seated position, bring the soles of your feet together, a comfortable
  distance away from your pelvis.
- Fold forward from the hips, allowing your spine to round, placing your hands
  in front of you.
- Relax your legs and spine and allow gravity to work with your body weight.
- Hold for 3 to 5 minutes. Eventually this pose can be held up to 20 minutes.
- To come out of the pose, use your hands to push the floor away and allow your
  spine to slowly unroll.
- Use your hands to bring your knees towards each other.
- Place your arms behind you and lean back to release your hips, and straighten
  your legs.
- Allow your body to settle in this seated position, before moving to a counter
  pose.

## Beginners' tips

- You may want to sit on a folded blanket or a pillow to facilitate the folding
  forward action.
- You could support your knees / thighs with blocks if the sensation is too
  strong in the thighs or groin.
- If this pose is too intense for you, you might want to try a Reclined
  Butterfly variation.

## Watch out for

- Can aggravate Sciatica
- In case of lower back injuries, explore the Reclined Butterfly version

## Variations

- Adjust the position of your legs to allow your spine to fold forward: you
  might want to bring your feet closer to your pelvis or even separate your feet
  a few centimeters apart from each other.
- Support your head with your fists or a block in case of neck issues.
- Support your chest with a bolster placed across your thighs.
- Support your chest and head by placing a bolster on your feet, towards your
  pelvis and elevate the furthest part of the bolster with blocks.
- Place folded blankets or blocks under your knees if the groinÂ or hips are
  tight.
- If you are very comfortable in this pose, a wheat-filled bolster or sandbag
  could be placed along the spine and/or on the thighs (never on the knees).
- Try Butterfly at the wall: lie with your hips against the wall, legs up. Bend
  the knee, placing the soles of your feet together, allowing your knees to open
  up to the sides.
