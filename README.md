## Curve

Muscles are typically tight on both sides of the curve.

**GOAL**: Lengthen concave curve and strengthen convex curve.

### Convex Curve

"Outside of curve": Muscles are longer and need to be **strengthened**.

### Concave Curve

"Inside of curve": Muscles are shorter and need to be **lengthened**.

## Basics to consider

Carry on left shoulder or left hand groceries, computer bag, luggage, etc. Add
core strengthening workouts to daily regimen; crunches, leg lifts, especially
the [transverse abs]. Drive either both hands on the wheel or left hand on the
wheel. Try using the mouse on the left side vs the right side.

Avoid any backbends or upper spine temporarily. Focus on more lumbar spine
decompression. Avoid most twists temporarily.
