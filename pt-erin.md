# PT with Erin Chain

## [Transversus Activation][0d2cb059ad]: 08:13

Remember to take a minute or two and be sure to engage Transversus prior to
starting:

Engage: Lie flat on your back and bend your knees with feet flat on the floor.
Place your fingers in your hip crease and inhale deeply. Exhale and draw your
belly towards your spine. You should feel tension, indicating you've located the
TVA muscles.

## [Hip Internal Rotation: Level 1][07d5b36adc]: 12:37

Enjoy this PT Lab that is Specific to those that have been diagnosed with
decreased hip internal rotation and or pelvic unbalance.  When we have decreased
hip internal rotation/ and unbalanced hips/pelvis,  a whole slew of things can
start to "talk to us".  If we do not have the requisite hip internal rotation to
accommodate the demands of a  sport or activity we love (hip internal rotation
force greater than available hip internal rotation) we can damage the soft
tissue structures of the actual hip or compensate poorly and have a whole host
of injuries in the muscles, tendons and ligaments of our hip and furthermore.
When we lack mobility in the hip our body will mobilize somewhere where it
should not: the back, the lower leg, etc.... as our body tries to do the work
that the hip cannot.

## [15-Minute Balance Blast][0c1084e567]: 14:38

Enjoy this 15 minute balance blast as a workout for your balance system.  Notice
differences side to side-notice responses in one foot vs the other. Notice hip
range of motion and notice your ability of your eyes to support your balance
system.  Workout done all in standing and frontal/sagittal planes.

## [Recharge Release][fc299017d1]: 16:35

17 minutes of recharge and release-focused on releasing common spots of
tension-shoulders/thoracic spine, hips, hamstrings, toe flexors.  Engagement
work in abs to promote positive posture for the day.

### [Lower Extremity Releases][22d15af9c4]: 16:35

Be mindful of spots of tension and listen to them and notice the change you
create as you make this 16 minute barre release part of your daily habits.  This
is great before a long walk, prior to yoga and at the end of the day.

16-minute Lower Extremity Release: unlock fascial restrictions that may be
present. Provide feedback on your hamstring tension and what you notice.

Tips throughout the programming:

* Be mindful of the 4 corners of the feet
* Keep knee tracking over 2nd and 3rd toes
* Keep belly to spine throughout practice and let us know if it is hard to
  coordinate breathing with this engagement
