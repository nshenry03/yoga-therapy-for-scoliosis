## Hamstring active stretch

Assume the position in the picture below.

![Example of a man doing the hamstring active stretch](/images/pt/hamstring-active-stretch.png "Hamstring active stretch")

Dig heel into table (with a slight knee bend) until you feel the hamstrings
tighten hold for 5 seconds then relax and lean forward until you feel a stretch
and hold for 30 seconds.

Repeat this 3x.

## Walking Hamstring stretch

![Example of a man doing the walking hamstring stretch](/images/pt/walking-hamstring-stretch.png "Walking Hamstring stretch")

Put one foot out in front of you with the other leg gently bent and lean forward
until you feel a stretch, hold 5-6 seconds then take a step and perform with the
other leg.

Walk about 6 laps of approximately 30 feet.

## Hip Rotation Mobilizations (Lateral Hip Distraction)

Mobilize your hip capusle and improve rotational mobility with this lateral hip
distraction technique.

Follow the example in [this video][y2cIGFPC_Do]!

Perform for about 2-3 minutes per day.

## Self Hip Mobilization

Follow the directions and set up in [this video][XTMjQ-yx8CY].

In addition to rocking back and forth you can also drive the knee forward like
doing mountain climbers.

Perform for about 2-3 minutes per day.

## Sciatic Nerve glide

Follow the instructions in [this video][BjYUkAwpRsY]!

Helping to mobilize and stretch the sciatic nerve decreases the numbness in the
back of the leg.

Perform 20 slow repetitions per day.

## Hip internal rotation movement

Start laying on your stomach with one hip elevated toward head as shown below.

![Example of a Sarah doing the hip internal rotation movement](/images/pt/hip-internal-rotation-movement.png "Hip internal rotation movement")

Lift the ankle off the ground as far as you can rotating at the hip. Hold for 3
seconds then relax.

Repeat 20x.

## Hip internal rotation stretch

Start in the following position with both legs bent the same direction. Then
rotate your body toward the back leg and gently pull until a light stretch is
felt in the hip.

![Example of a Sarah doing the hip internal rotation stretch](/images/pt/hip-internal-rotation-stretch.png "Hip internal rotation stretch")

Hold 30 seconds breathing deeply. Repeat 3x.

## Posterior Mobilization

Assume a hands and knees position, then bring one leg back with your toes on the
floor and knee straight as shown.

![Example of a Sarah doing the posterior mobilization](/images/pt/posterior-mobilization.png "Posterior Mobilization")

Rotate the kneeling leg by crossing your ankle underneath the opposite leg (this
resembles a "Pidgeon" position). Your thigh should be close to perpendicular to
the floor (straight up). Press your body weight over the kneecap of the front
leg to increase the pressure in the hip. Progress onto your elbows, keeping your
weight primarily on the rotated leg. You should feel a stretch in the back of
your rotated hip. Keep your core and glutes engaged throughout this exercise to
stabilize your spine.

This stretch will be performed for a total of 2 minutes.
For maximum benefit, shift your pelvis forward and backward, side-to-side, and
circularly with a hold of 5 seconds when you feel the stretch the most.
