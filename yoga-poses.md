# Yoga Poses

Because of the way my spine is curved, I need to focus on stretching my right
side.

## [Supported Bridge]

Setu Bandha Sarvangasana

### Supported Bridge Step-by-Step Instructions

You will need your yoga block or a similar solid bolster handy.

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet flat on the
   floor.
1. Extend your arms on the floor with your fingers reaching toward your heels.
   You should be able to just barely touch the backs of your heels with your
   fingertips.
1. Keep your feet parallel. Maintain that position throughout the pose.
1. Press down into the soles of your feet to lift your hips off the floor.
1. Slide your yoga block under your back directly under your sacrum, letting it
   rest securely on the bolster. Your arms can stay outstretched on the floor
   next to your body.
1. This should be a comfortable position. You may want to stay here several
   minutes as your body settles into the stretch and gets the benefits of a
   passive backbend. If the pose causes your back to hurt, remove the block and
   come down.
1. To come out, press down into your feet and lift your hips again. Slide the
   block out from under your sacrum and gently lower your back to the floor.

### Supported Bridge Common Mistakes

Beginners and those with back pain should be sure that the block is under the
sacrum, which is between the coccyx (tailbone) and the lower back. You don't
want the block centered too much on the tailbone or the lower back, but rather
in that sweet spot in between.

### Supported Bridge Modifications and Variations

Beginners can find a modification to make this pose easier while developing
their skills. You can also make changes to challenge yourself as you progress.

#### Supported Bridge Modifications

A standard yoga block can be set up at three different heights, depending on the
side that is on the floor. When you first try this pose, it's a good idea to
start with the block on the lowest height, since this is its most stable and
gentle position.

If the lowest height feels comfortable and you want a deeper stretch, you can
try turning it. The highest height will give you the deepest backbend, but it is
also the least stable, so go carefully. Since this is a restorative pose, choose
the level that gives you the most ease. If you feel any pain, come out.

#### Supported Bridge Challenges

If you feel very stable, try lifting one leg off the floor while keeping the
block in place under your sacrum. Straighten your lifted leg up to the ceiling,
or try bending it and placing your ankle on the thigh of the opposite leg (the
one still on the floor) for a hip opener. Keep the foot of the raised leg flexed
in either position. After several breaths, return that foot to the floor and try
the other side.

You may also lift both legs at the same time, which is a supported version
of [Shoulder Stand].

## [Reclined Big Toe Pose]

Supta Padangusthasana

### Reclined Big Toe Pose Step by step

- Lie on your back, legs extended, feet flexed pressing out through the heels.
- On an exhalation draw the right knee into your chest, loop a strap around the
  arch of the right foot, or hook your first two fingers around your big toe.
- Extend the right leg up to the ceiling. Straighten your arms but keep both
  your shoulders on the mat.
- Keep your left leg engaged and press the top of your left thigh down with your
  hand.  Extend through the right heel creating a comfortable stretch in your
  hamstrings.
- Stay for 5 breaths, then open your right leg out bringing it towards the floor
  on your right side. Keep the left hip grounded. Stay for 5 more breaths.
- Bring your leg back to centre and then lower it back to the mat. Repeat on the
  other side.

### Reclined Big Toe Pose tips

- You can keep your left leg bent, foot flat on the floor while extending the
  right leg with the help of a strap. Then when bringing the bent leg out to the
  side let the other leg fall out to the other side as well to balance the
  hips.
- Use a pillow under your head if it’s more comfortable for you.
- When bringing the leg out to the side you can rest the thigh on a block or
  cushion to allow more release in the inner thigh.

### Reclined Big Toe Pose Watch out for

- Use the strap as long as you need it to avoid over-stretching your hamstrings.
- Keep the muscles of both legs active, extending through the heels. However,
  avoid locking the knees. Think about engaging the thighs and lifting the knee
  caps as in [Mountain Pose].

## [Bananasana]

### Bananasana Step by step

- Lie down on your back, legs straight, arms overhead.
- With your buttocks firmly anchored on the mat, move both of your legs to the
  left. Use your left foot to keep your right foot in place, by crossing your
  ankles
- Buttocks still anchored on the mat, bring your upper body to the left allowing
  your spine to bend to the side, clasping your right wrist with your right hand
- Hold for 3 to 5 minutes
- You are looking for stimulation in the side body. You may feel more sensations
  in the upper body (ribs, shoulders, arms), the lower body (along the hips and
  thighs) or both.
- To come out of the pose, slowly bring your body back to neutral.
- Lift your head to make sure that you’re lying straight and take a few moments
  in Savasana to integrate the effects of this pose.

### Bananasana tips

You might not feel much in this pose right away. Take a few moments to allow the
first sensations to arise then adjust further if you’re looking for greater
sensation.

### Bananasana Watch out for

Avoid any tingling sensations in the arms. If this occurs, adjust the arm
position, elevate them with a bolster or try holding onto your elbows instead of
your wrists.

### Bananasana Variations

- You can adjust the position of your pelvis to target sensations in the front
  side body or the back side body.
- Use a strap to go deeper in the pose: Make a small loop and place it around
  your left ankle. Hold the other side of the strap, as low as possible, with
  your left hand. Use your right arm to put tension on the strap (a bit like a
  bow and an arrow). Doing this can intensify the side bend, while still keeping
  the muscles relaxed.

## [Child's Pose]

### Child's Pose Step by step

- Sit on your heels
- Bring your upper body to the left allowing your spine to bend to the side
- Bring your head down to the floor, on stacked fists or a block (arms can be
  either stretched out to the front, by your side or hands underneath your
  forehead)
- Hold the pose for 90 seconds to 5 minutes
- To come out, roll up vertebra by vertebra, head comes up last
- Bring your upper body to the right allowing your spine to bend to the side
- Bring your head down to the floor
- Hold for 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Come out of the pose as before
- Bring your upper body to the center allowing your spine lengthen equally
  between both sides
- Bring your head down to the floor
- Hold for 90 seconds to 5 minutes
- Come out of the pose as before
- Sit on your heels for a few moments

### Child's Pose tips

- If ankles are tight, place a rolled up blanket underneath to diminish the
  stretch.
- If hips do not reach the heels, place a cushion or bolster on your heels for
  support.

### Child's Pose Watch out for

- Avoid if pregnant.
- In case of back issues, spread your knees wider to keep the spine straight.

### Child's Pose Variations

- In case of knee issues, place a rolled up blanket behind your knee joint, in
  between your thighs and calves.
- Spread your knees if you feel compression in the groin, and place a bolster
  lengthwise under your chest.
- If your hips rest on your your heels, place a wheat-filled meditation cushion
  or sandbag on your sacrum for a grounding sensation.
